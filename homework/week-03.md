### Friday/Weekend
To submit on today's [pulse check](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe7KpquxAEpvf5gCdfEbt4RIFbmkiTKL8i_-P_9bcvG5zxnQQ/viewform): Your fork of the express intro repo(https://github.com/SF-WDI-LABS/express-intro)

* finish up Todo Lab
* Take a glance over the [Mongoose Docs](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/) and check out the syntax used to make a new document, save the document, and find documents later. You don't have to memorize the methods now, but look over them.
* Build an API of your own! Pick a resource, whether it's movies, recipes, restaurants, parks, customers, or anything of your choice. Decide what attributes that resource might have (name, phone number, address, title, director, etc.) and build the following routes (example routes for movies):

  - GET all               (GET /api/movies)
  - GET one by id         (GET /api/movies/:id)
  - POST one              (POST /api/movies)
  - PUT one by id         (PUT /api/movies/:id)
  - DELETE one by id      (DELETE /api/movies/:id)

  Test your routes using Postman to make sure they're functional!
